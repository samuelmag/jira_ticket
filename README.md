# jira_ticket

A small Python utility for working with Jira tickets.

Note: I made a small, reasonable assumption when writing this README â€” based on the repository name `jira_ticket` and the presence of a `test.py` and a `.env` file, I assume this project is a Python script/tool that interacts with a Jira API and uses environment variables for configuration. If this assumption is incorrect, tell me and I will update the README.

## What this project is

A lightweight Python-based tool to create and/or manage Jira tickets from the command line or from scripts. The repository currently contains a simple runner script (`test.py`) and an environment configuration file (`.env`) for secrets and runtime settings.

Key idea:
- Keep Jira credentials and config in `.env`.
- Provide a small script or library that performs ticket operations (create, update, comment, etc.).

## Features (typical)

- Create a new Jira issue
- Add comments to issues
- Transition issues between statuses
- Load configuration from `.env`

If you have additional features (bulk import, templates, webhooks), add them to this list and I can expand the README.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- pip (Python package manager)
- A Jira account and API token (if using Jira Cloud)

## Install

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (PowerShell example):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install project dependencies (if you maintain `requirements.txt`):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt` yet, add one listing the libraries you need (for example `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `jira`/`atlassian-python-api`).

## Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file at the project root with the required environment variables. Example:

```
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
DEFAULT_PROJECT=PROJ
```

Make sure `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Usage

Run the main script (example):

```powershell
python test.py
```

If `test.py` is a small example runner, it may accept command-line args or read instructions from a config file. Typical usage patterns:

- Create issue: `python main.py create --summary "Bug: ..." --description "Steps to reproduce..."`
- Comment: `python main.py comment --issue PROJ-123 --text "This is a comment"`

Replace `main.py` with the actual script name when you add it to the repo.

## Development

- Add unit tests under `tests/` and run with `pytest`.
- Use `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt` to lock dependencies for this project.

## Troubleshooting

- Authentication errors: confirm `JIRA_API_TOKEN` and `JIRA_EMAIL` are correct.
- Network errors: ensure `JIRA_BASE_URL` is reachable from your network.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Typical steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add tests for new behavior
4. Open a PR with a clear description

## License

Add a LICENSE file describing the license you want to use (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.). If you're not sure, MIT is a common permissive choice.

## Contact

If you want the README tailored or prefer different wording/sections, tell me what to change and I'll update it.

If the assumption about the project's purpose is wrong, or if you want the README to emphasize a different aspect (for example a web UI, demo scripts, or CI integration), reply with a brief note and I'll regenerate the README accordingly.
